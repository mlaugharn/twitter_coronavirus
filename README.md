# Coronavirus analysis

This repo analyzes the activity of coronavirus hashtags on twitter.

The input was all geotagged tweets from 2020. Following the map-reduce paradigm every tweet featuring certain hashtags relating to coronavirus were recorded, by country and by language, on a daily basis, and then aggregated. I also separated the visualization output so that country and language statistics remained distinct.
